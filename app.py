SEO optimization best practices: 

Keyphrase-based assessments
Keyphrase in introduction
Checks whether words from the keyphrase can be found in the first paragraph of the text.
Updated: Keyphrase length
Checks whether the number of (content) words in the keyphrase is within the recommended limit. For languages with function word support only content words are considered. For languages without function word support all words are considered.
Updated: Keyphrase density
Checks whether the (content) words from the keyphrase are used in the text and whether they are used often enough (but not too often). For a match to be found, all content words should occur in one sentence. Multiple occurrences of all content words within one sentence are considered multiple matches.
Keyphrase in meta description
Checks whether all (content) words from the keyphrase are used in the meta description. A match is counted if all words from the keyphrase appear in a sentence. Multiple matches per sentence are counted multiple times.
Updated: Keyphrase in subheadings
Checks whether the subheadings reflect the topic of the copy (based on keyphrase or synonyms). A subheading is considered to reflect the topic if at least one (content) word from the keyphrase is used in it.
Link focus keyphrase
Checks if there are links in the text, whose link text contains keyphrase.
Updated: Keyphrase in image alt attributes
Checks if there are keyphrase or synonyms in the alt attributes of images.
Updated: Keyphrase in title
Checks if the keyphrase is used in the page title.
Keyphrase in slug
Checks if the keyphrase is used in the URL.
Previously used keyphrase
Checks if the words from the keyphrase were previously used in a keyphrase for a different post.
Keyphrase distribution (only in Premium)
Checks how well the words from the keyphrase are distributed throughout the text.
 


What is a focus keyphrase?
A focus keyphrase is a phrase that you want your post or page to rank for.


Let’s say you want to write a post about how to make a sourdough starter. To find the optimal keyphrase, you’ll need to do some research and discover what people are looking for and what words they’re using. This will increase your chances of getting found. FInally, you might end up with a keyphrase like “make sourdough starter”. Then, when people search for instructions on how to make it, they might find your post in Google’s search results (very much depending on what the competition does, of course).


Starting off your texts with the focus keyphrase
Writing a good, informative introduction is crucial. With just a few lines, you need to grab the attention of your readers and get them to stay on your page. It is worth remembering that most people scan pages rather than read them with complete attention. So if you include your focus keyphrase right at the start, you’ll make it easier for your readers to understand what your page is about.


What about search engines?
Readers are not the only ones you need to woo with the introduction. Search engines like to “read” introductions too. So if you include your focus keyphrase at the start of your text, you’re giving search engines clues about the topic of your post. Moreover, Google sometimes uses your first paragraph to create a meta description. So you’ll do yourself a huge favor by including your focus keyphrase at the start.


How can you write good introductions that include the focus keyphrase? 
Great question! A good paragraph and introduction start with a core sentence, which is a sentence that includes the most important message of that paragraph. If you can, add your focus keyphrase to that core sentence. Next, use the rest of the paragraph to discuss what readers can expect from the post. You can also mention the post’s purpose, and explain your structure in your introduction.


And don’t forget that your audience doesn’t only consist of returning visitors who are familiar with your stories and products. Always take the perspective of a new visitor. Ask yourself: Does my introduction give new visitors enough clues on what my post is about?


Stay on topic
Another thing to keep in mind: Be concise and precise. Try not to wander or start writing about an irrelevant topic. One way to keep yourself from digressing too much is to use the inverted pyramid writing style. This method encourages you to get to the heart of the matter immediately. Your readers will be thankful for it.


What if you can’t use the keyphrase at the start?
Sometimes, you won’t be able to use the focus keyphrase at the very start. For example, you might want to catch your readers’ attention with an anecdote or a question. In such cases, follow up with your focus keyphrase as soon as you can. This way, you still make it clear what your page or post is about.


Don’t overdo it
Be careful not to overuse your keyphrase, since it can make your text repetitive.

What is a focus keyphrase?
The focus keyphrase is the phrase that you want your post or page to be found for in search engines. Sometimes, it is a single word, but it usually consists of a few words. That’s why we call it a keyphrase. For example, if you want your blog post to rank for ‘healthy snacks’, then optimize your post for that term. Your focus keyphrase can also be longer. For instance, you could write an article about healthy snacks specifically made for kids and optimize for ‘healthy snacks for kids’. Or a post about healthy snacks to eat after a workout, and optimize for ‘healthy snacks after workout’. 


Why is the keyphrase length important for SEO?
There are different approaches to choosing a keyphrase for your posts or pages. You can choose to optimize your article for a short, generic keyword. These are the more common keywords that get a lot of search traffic. But, they also have a great deal of competition. Like, ‘snacks’, for example. A lot of people will search for this term. However, there will be many companies optimizing for it. In the image below, the body of the mouse represents these less specific keyphrases.


Google is capable of recognizing the separate words from longer search terms, even if the words are not in the exact same order as the query. For instance, if you Google [easy to use and short site structure guide] you’ll get these results:




Google highlights the words (and word forms) of your keyphrase in the search results
You can see that Google highlights the words (and different word forms) of this search term in the search results, even though they’re not in the exact same order as the original query.


You can also choose to optimize for a longer, more specific keyphrase, represented by the tail in the image above. These longer keyphrases are also called long-tail keyphrases. They get less search traffic, but they usually have a higher conversion value. That is because they focus more on a specific product or topic. For example, a lot of people would probably search for the generic term ‘snacks’. And, fewer people would search for the long tail keyphrase – ‘healthy snacks for children’. Still, there’s a higher chance that the people who use the long tail keyphrase will find what they are looking for because they used a more specific term. 


Longer keyphrases make it harder to optimize your post. Since you’ll need to repeatedly use a large number of words close to each other, it will be hard to keep your copy readable


For example, if you want to rank for the keyphrase [easy to use and short site structure guide], I would advise optimizing your post for [easy site structure guide] and use the related keyphrase field for [short site structure guide]. Of course, you can use this field for more topical keyphrases too. In this case, [internal linking] would be a nice, on-topic example. If you optimize your posts this way, you’ll make sure you’re optimizing for all the specifics of your long-tail focus keyword.


This functionality enables you to focus on multiple aspects of a long-tail keyword. The readability of your text will not suffer, and you’ll still make sure you cover all the aspects of a long search term in your writing. Plus, you’ll be able to enter synonyms of your keyphrase too!


The boundaries we use for this assessment depend on whether we can take out the function words for your language or not. If we can, the boundary is four words. In case we can’t take them out, the boundary is six words. If your keyphrase is longer than that, you’ll find an orange or red bullet in the SEO assessment of your post!

What is keyphrase or keyword density?
Keyphrase density is the number of times your focus keyphrase occurs in your copy, compared to the total text of that page. So if you have a text that is 100 words and 5 of those are your focus keyphrase, your keyphrase density is 5%. We used to call it keyword density, but nowadays it’s more common to focus on a search term that consists of more than one word. That’s why we rather call it keyphrase density in Yoast SEO.


It is good to note that using your exact keyphrase a specific amount of times has become less important than before. Although your text still needs to reflect the topic you want to rank for, Google has evolved these last few years. This means that using your exact keyphrase is no longer the only way to show Google what your text is about. We do still have this check in our plugin as it gives you an indication of whether your text is still on topic and whether you’re not going overboard with the use of your keyphrase.


Why is it important for SEO?
Your keyphrase density is important for SEO because Google tries to match a user’s search query to the best-fitting page out there. To match your pages with a certain query, Google needs to understand what the page is about. That’s why you need to use your keyphrase, the phrase you’d like to rank for, in your copy. Luckily, this often comes naturally. If you want to rank for, for instance [bake vegan pancakes] you probably use this phrase or variations of it throughout your text.


However, if you repeat your keyphrase too often in your copy it becomes unpleasant to read. That’s something you should avoid at all times. After all, you want users to enjoy and understand your copy well. A high keyphrase density is also a signal to Google that you might be stuffing your text with keywords – also known as over-optimizing. As Google likes to show the best result to users, both in relevance and readability, this can negatively affect your rankings.


What does the keyphrase density check do?
The keyphrase density check in Yoast SEO assesses whether you’ve used the word(s) from your focus keyphrase often enough in your copy. It also checks if you didn’t go overboard and use the keyphrase too often. It’s good to know that the length of your keyphrase plays a factor in how your score is calculated. If you choose a longer phrase, it might be much more difficult to use it a certain number of times in your text, than if you’re using a shorter keyphrase. The check takes this into consideration to preserve the readability of your text.


We’ve included the length of your keyphrase as a weighting factor when calculating keyphrase density. That means that you will need to use your longer keyphrase less often in the text than your shorter keyphrase, to get a green traffic light. Not only do we tell you how many times you already used your keyphrase in the text, we also give you an idea about how many times you should use it.


The keyphrase density assessment in Yoast SEO
An example of the keyphrase density assessment feedback in Yoast SEO
In the free version of Yoast SEO for WordPress, you’ll get a green traffic light if your keyphrase density lies between 0.5 and 3%. For a match to be counted, all words should occur in one sentence, but the order of the words may differ.


In certain languages, Yoast SEO Premium and Yoast SEO for Shopify recognize various word forms of your keyphrase. For instance, [train], [trained] or [training]. This means that Yoast SEO picks up on these variations and sees them as forms of your chosen keyphrase. Making it easier for you to naturally write about your topic and be less concerned about using your keyphrase often enough.


Let’s say you’d like to rank for [bake vegan pancakes]. If you write, “Here, you’ll learn how to bake the best vegan pancakes” this will be counted as an occurrence of the keyphrase. Also, if you’d write “baking a vegan pancake is easy as pie”, Yoast SEO Premium and our Shopify app recognize that as the focus keyphrase as well. That’s why the upper boundary in these tools is a bit higher: 3.5% instead of 3%.


In Premium and our Shopify app, you can also enter related keyphrases. These are words and phrases that are connected to your focus keyphrase, but not synonyms. Any related keyphrases you add have a keyphrase density check of their own. So if the density of your focus keyphrase is too high, have a look at any related keyphrases and see if those are more suitable to use instead. 


How to improve your keyphrase density
If your keyphrase density score is too low, that means that it’s not clear enough that your text is about that specific topic. In that case, you should use the keyphrase (or variations of it) more often. Check your copy and make sure you make clear what you’re writing about. Stay on topic! If the keyphrase density is too high, you’re using your keyphrase too often. Your text will probably come across as quite spammy, to both your website visitors and Google. 


Using synonyms is a great way to avoid repetitiveness. Synonyms do not count towards your keyphrase density score, as that exclusively looks at the use of your actual focus keyphrase. If you’ve used synonyms and are worried it might be too much, here’s a tip! Have a look at the keyphrase distribution check in Yoast SEO. That highlights your focus keywords and its synonyms throughout the text. If you’ve entered synonyms that is. By looking at the highlighted phrases you can determine whether your keyphrase (in any form) is mentioned often enough throughout the text. A good check to see whether you stay on topic until the end!


Why do I have a red score on the keyphrase density check?
If you get a red traffic light for using your focus keyphrase too often or not enough and you’re not sure why, here are some things to look out for.


Red score on the keyphrase density check
An example of a red feedback traffic light for the keyphrase density check
First off, make sure your full focus keyphrase is within one sentence to make sure it’s being counted.
Check your spelling. If you use [pancake] in your text, but wrote [pencake] in the focus keyphrase field, the plugin will not recognize it. Using capital letters, like in [Pancake] or even [PANCAKE] will not impact recognition though.
If your keyphrase density is too high, make better use of synonyms. Synonyms of your focus keyphrase will not count towards your total score, but they’ll probably make your text more pleasant to read.
Some page builders in WordPress conflict with our plugin. If our plugin is not able to find your content or your keyphrase due to a page builder, the results will be distorted. The fastest way to rule out conflicts is to perform a conflict check.
Some non-latin, non-ideograph based languages may not calculate accurately. Please submit a bug to notify us of that, it’s much appreciated.

What is a meta description?
The meta description is an HTML tag you can set for a post or page of your website. In it, you can use roughly 155 characters to describe what your page is about. If you’re lucky, Google will show it beneath your page’s title in the search results. It allows you to convince search engine users that your page will offer what they are looking for.


In Google’s search results, this is where it can be displayed:




A meta description from yoast.com, as seen in the search results
And this is what it looks like in the HTML code of the page, you see it doesn’t always use what you add to the page:


<meta name="description" content="Do you want people to click on your search result? Learn how to write the best meta description. Including 7 characteristics and examples!" />
Why set a meta description?
The purpose of a meta description is simple: it needs to get someone searching with a search term on Google to click your link. In other words, meta descriptions are there to generate click-throughs from search engines.


Search engines say there is no direct SEO benefit from the meta description – they don’t use it in their ranking algorithm. But there is an indirect benefit: Google uses click-through rate (CTR) to determine whether you’re a good result. If more people click on your result, Google considers you to be a good result and will – based on your position – move you up the rankings. This is why optimizing your meta description is important, as is optimizing your titles.


Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that Google will display the description that you’ve written. But, as there is a chance it will, adding it to your post or page is always worth the effort.


What does a good meta description contain?
Here’s a list of elements you need to write a good meta description:


Keep it up to 155 characters
Use an active voice and make it actionable
Include a call to action
Use your focus keyphrase
Show specifications when needed
Make sure it matches the content of the page
Make it unique
Let’s go over them in detail!


1. Keep it up to 155 characters 
The right length doesn’t exist; it depends on the message you want to convey. You should take enough space to convey the message but keep it short and snappy. However, if you check the search results in Google, you’ll mostly see snippets of 120 to 156 characters, like in the example below. Google says you can make your meta descriptions as long as you want, but there is a limit to what we can see in the SERPs — and that’s around 155 characters; anything longer will get truncated.




This search result from a Yoast SEO user shows a succinct meta description in Google
Unfortunately, you can’t fully control what Google displays in the search results. Sometimes, it shows the meta description, and sometimes, it just grabs some sentences of your copy. Either way, your best bet is to keep it short. That way, if Google does decide to show the description you’ve written, it won’t be cut short. 


2. Use active voice and make it actionable 
If you see the meta description as an invitation to visit your page, you have to think about your user and their (possible) motivation to visit your page. Ensure your description isn’t dull, difficult, or too cryptic. People need to know what they can expect to find on your page.


The example in the image below is the description you should strive to write. It’s active; it speaks to you and addresses you directly. You know what you’ll get if you click on the link!




Make people want to click your search result
3. Include a call-to-action
“Hello, we have a new product, and you want it. Find out more!” This overlaps with what we said about the active voice, but we wanted to emphasize it again. The meta description is your sales text. In this case, the “product” you are trying to sell is the linked page. Invitations like Learn more, Get it now, Try for free come in handy, and we use them too.




Get people to click on your link
4. Use your focus keyword
If the search keyword matches a part of the text in the meta description, Google will be more inclined to use it and highlight it in the search results. This will make the link to your site even more inviting. Google sometimes even highlights synonyms. In the example below, both the Academy Awards and Oscars are highlighted. Getting your results emphasized like that makes them stand out even more.


The image shows a meta description for the Wikipedia page about the Academy Awards. The words 'Academy Awards' and 'Oscars' are shown in bold text.
A listing for the Academy Awards on Google
5. Show specifications, where possible 
If you have a product in your Shopify or WooCommerce store aimed at the tech-savvy, it can be a good idea to focus on the technical specs. For example, you can include the manufacturer, SKU, price, etc. If the visitor specifically seeks that product, you won’t have to convince them. Can the watch help us stay fit? Sign us up; that’s all we need to know. Note that to optimize your result in this manner, you should work on getting rich snippets.

Make it spark
6. Make sure it matches the content of the page
This is an important one. Google will find out if you use meta descriptions to trick visitors into clicking on your results. They might even penalize you if you do it. But besides that, misleading descriptions will also increase your bounce rate. Which will also lower people’s trust in your company. It’s a bad idea for that reason alone. That is why you want the meta description to match the content on the page.


7. Make it unique 
Adding the date to the snippet preview
People often ask questions about the date shown in the Google preview of our Yoast SEO plugin. We’ve added this because search engines may display a date with your snippet. So it’s important to factor it in when you decide on the right length of your meta description. Unfortunately, there’s no way to directly control whether this date is shown or not, but you can try to manage the dates they use in the search results.


If your meta description is the same as those for other pages, the user experience in Google will be hampered. Although your page titles might vary, all pages will appear the same because all the descriptions are identical. Instead of creating duplicate meta descriptions, you’d better leave them blank. Google will pick a snippet from the page containing the keyword used in the query. That being said, writing a unique meta description for every page you want to rank with is always the best practice.


What does the keyphrase in meta description assessment in Yoast SEO do?
This check is all about using the keyphrase in the meta description. A focus keyphrase is the search term you want a page to rank with. When people use that term, you want them to find your page. You base your keyphrase on keyword research. After your research, you should end up with a combination of words that most of your audience will likely search for. We’ve already discussed that when you use your keyphrase in the meta description, Google will likely highlight it. That makes it easier for people to see they’ve found what they are looking for. 


Yoast SEO checks if and how often you use the words from your focus keyphrase in the meta description text. In addition, if you use Yoast SEO Premium, it also considers the synonyms you enter. If you overdo it, the plugin advises you to limit the use of your focus keyphrase.

How to get a green traffic light for the keyphrase in meta description
You’ll get a red traffic light if you don’t mention the keyphrase in the meta description. So, make sure to write one. But don’t stuff your meta description with your keyphrase because that will also get you a red traffic light. And make sure to mention all the words from your keyphrase near each other. Search engines are pretty smart nowadays, but you must clarify what your page is about. 


What does the meta description length assessment do?
This meta description length assessment measures whether your description is too short (less than 120 characters) or too long (more than 156 characters).  You’ll get a green traffic light when your meta description has the right length. If it’s too long or too short, you’ll get an orange traffic light in the SEO analysis of Yoast SEO (or red if you’ve marked your article as cornerstone content).

How to write a concise meta description
A good meta description convinces people that your page offers the best result for their query. But, to be the best result, you must know what people seek. What is their search intent? Are they looking for an answer to a question? If they are, try to give them the most complete answer. Are they looking for a product? Write down what makes your product stand out and why they would best buy it in your store. Be concise and convincing!

Why use headings?
Use headings to show text structure
Headings are signposts that guide readers through an article. Therefore, they should indicate what a section or a paragraph is about. Otherwise, people won’t know what to expect.


Readers like to scan content to understand the text and decide which sections they will read. Headings help them do that. Scanning the text becomes significantly harder for your readers when it contains no headings. It’s even worse when you add long stretches of text after a heading. You don’t want to scare off people with the infamous wall of text.


Ensuring your headings are informative to the reader is good practice for web copy. Some people like to tease their audience in the headings, trying to entice them to read further. While that can work well, it’s also easy to get wrong. Remember that the main focus of headings should be on the content – and the primary purpose should be to make the text easier to read and understand.


Also, keep the following two things in mind: firstly, a paragraph should start with a core sentence on which you elaborate in the rest of the paragraph. When restructuring your text to add a heading, make sure the first sentence of your paragraph contains the essential information of that paragraph. Secondly, consider how the information is structured in your paragraphs, the relation between paragraphs, and how a subheading can help make that information easier to digest.

Use headings to improve accessibility
Heading structure is essential for accessibility as well, especially for people who can’t easily read from a screen. Because headings are in HTML, a screen reader can understand the article structure and read them out loud. By reading or listening to the headings in an article, visually impaired people can decide whether or not to read an article. Also, screen readers offer shortcuts to jump from one heading to the next, so they are also used for navigation.


Don’t forget that, in many cases, what’s good for accessibility is also good for SEO!

Use headings to improve SEO
It’s generally agreed that how you use headings doesn’t specifically impact your SEO. Making minor tweaks to individual headings likely won’t help your performance. However, there are indirect benefits. Using headings creates texts of higher quality that are easier to read. A better text is better for users, which is better for your SEO.


If visitors can’t quickly find what they’re looking for, they’ll probably leave your site and look for another answer to their question. This is why text structure and heading use also impact SEO. Search engines pick up on people bouncing from your site. When you have a high bounce rate, search engines can conclude that your page doesn’t give searchers what they want. Consequently, you might get lower ratings.


With headings, you should always put the user first. Use them to add structure and signposts to your content and to describe what each section is about. If your headings let users know what your article is about, they’ll also help Google understand your content.


How to use headings effectively
So, what is the best way to use headings? There are two things that we can advise you on: you should structure your headings well, and you should use your keyphrase in them. Yoast SEO can help you in both cases. The readability analysis checks how you distribute your headings. And, in the SEO analysis, it checks whether you’ve used your keyphrase in the headings. So, let’s explore the importance of these two aspects and look at how you can use Yoast SEO to write great headings. 


Structuring your headings
NOTE: There are two different sets of ‘rules’ when it comes to how to use HTML heading tags; the ‘classic’ approach (from the HTML4 standard), and, the ‘modern’ approach (from the HTML5 standard). We’re going to focus on the classic approach, as there are some usability and SEO challenges with the modern approach (you can read more about that here).


When editing an article in WordPress or Shopify, you’ll usually see different ‘levels’ of headings in the text editor – from ‘Heading 1‘ to ‘Heading 6‘. These come in different sizes, moving from largest to smallest. Behind the scenes, these are converted into HTML heading tags from <h1> to <h6>. Your theme probably uses these HTML tags in its templates, too.


That’s why, when we talk about how to structure headings and content well, we talk about H1 tags, H2 tags, etc. We’re referring to the underlying HTML code to differentiate between the levels of headings.


Also, remember that the H1 is a heading tag used for on-page organization and structure, while the SEO title is an optimized headline that appears in search engine results.


How to structure your headings
Your H1 isn’t the same thing as your page title. For more information, you can read about the difference between an H1 and the SEO title.


Firstly, you are limited to using one H1 heading on each page. The H1 heading should be the name/title of the page or post. On this page, that’s “How to use headings on your site”. You can think of your H1 like you would think of the name of a book. For example, on a category page, your H1 would be the name of that category. Or, on a product page, it should be the product name.


Then, as you write your content, you can use H2 and H3 subheadings to introduce different sections – like the “How to improve the distribution of your headings“ section, which you’re currently reading, which sits within the “Structuring your headings” section. Think of H2 subheadings like the chapters of a book. Those sections might also use more specific headers (H3 tags, then H4 tags, etc.) to introduce sub-sections. It’s rare for most content to get ‘deep’ enough to need to use H4 tags and beyond unless you’re writing really long, or really technical content.


What does the subheading distribution check in Yoast SEO do?
The subheading distribution check assesses whether you’ve used enough subheadings in your text. Most texts of over 300 words need subheadings to help readers scan the text. So, this check will notify you if your text is longer than 300 words and doesn’t contain any subheadings. It’ll also let you know if a text section following a subheading is too long — i.e., more than 300 words – and suggest you add subheadings to improve the readability of that part of the text.


How to get a green traffic light for your subheading distribution
So, what do you do if you get an orange or red traffic light in the Yoast SEO plugin for your subheading distribution? Well, first of all – and this is quite obvious – don’t forget to use subheadings! You should try to create a subheading for every separate topic in your text. This could be for every paragraph or a couple discussing the same topic. 


We advise putting a heading above every long paragraph or a group of paragraphs forming a thematic unit. The text following a subheading generally should not be longer than 250-350 words.


An example heading structure
Let’s say that we have a blog post about ballet shoes. We’ve chosen “ballet shoes” as our focus keyword, and written an article about why we like ballet shoes. Without headings, there’s a risk that we might end up writing a long, rambling piece that is hard to understand. But if we structure things logically using headings, we make it easier to read and help focus our writing.


Here’s what the structure of that post might look like:


H1: Ballet shoes are awesome
H2: Why we think ballet shoes are awesome
H3: They don’t just come in pink!
H3: You can use them for more than just dancing
H3: They might be less expensive than you think
H2: Where should you buy your ballet shoes?
H3: The ten best ballet equipment websites
H3: Our favorite local dancing shops
See how we’ve created a logical structure, using H2 tags to plan sections and H3 tags to cover specific topics? We’ve done the same thing in the post you’re reading right now!


This is an excellent example of how your headings should be structured in a medium-length article. You should use fewer (or more general, high-level) headings for a shorter article. If you want to go into more detail, nothing stops you from using H4 tags to create even ‘lower-level’ sections.


Headings allow you to prominently use your focus keyword (or its synonyms) to clarify what the page is about. By adding your focus keyphrase to your subheadings, you stress its importance. Moreover, if you’re trying to rank for keywords, you must write about it. You’ll probably have difficulty ranking if none of your paragraphs address the main topic.


Still, just like keyphrases, it’s important not to overdo it. Add your keyphrase where it makes sense, and leave it out where it doesn’t.


Yoast SEO can help you with the keyphrase in headings assessment 
After you insert your keyphrase in Yoast SEO, the keyphrase in subheadings assessment checks whether you’ve used it sufficiently. In Yoast SEO, you’ll get a green traffic light if you use the keywords in 30 to 75% of your subheadings.


How to add your keyphrase in your subheadings
Whether you add your keyphrase to a subheading depends on the paragraph(s) it’s connected to. Every paragraph in your text should tell the reader something about the topic. In addition, your subheadings are nothing more than a very short outline of what you will say in one or more paragraphs. Therefore, adding your keyphrase to one or more subheadings should always be possible. If you’re still struggling to achieve this, ask yourself a couple of questions about the structure of your article.


Does my text discuss the topic described in the keyphrase? If not, should I pick other keywords?
Do my current subheadings accurately describe what I discuss below?
What paragraphs are most closely connected to the topic and the keyphrase?
What questions do these paragraphs answer concerning the topic and the keyphrase?
Most of the time, you’ll find that answering these questions helps you add the keywords to one or more of your subheadings. If you can’t, you should probably consider question number one again. If that doesn’t solve your problems, consider educating yourself on copywriting and text structure, to get a clearer view of how a good piece is structured. Your keyphrase should be central to the topic. Therefore, you should be able to add the keywords to several subheadings.


Headings in themes
Most themes will use headings as part of their HTML code, but some don’t follow best practices. Almost all themes will automatically use the name of your article in an H1 tag. This is helpful because you don’t need to repeat the post name inside your content.


Unfortunately, some themes use tags incorrectly – in an illogical order (e.g., an H4, then an H2) or use tags messily in sidebars, headers, and footers. This can cause problems for accessibility, as the order of your headings might not make sense. Users, search engines, and assistive technologies usually look at the whole page, not just your content area.


If you have a custom theme, you might be able to fix this by adjusting your HTML code. You may need to contact the developers if you’re using an off-the-shelf theme. Either way, you should check whether your headings make sense on each template type on your website!


Check your blog’s headings
Using headings well is helpful for your users. It increases the chances of people reading your article, improves accessibility, and might even contribute to SEO. So add them to your copy – make sure you use them correctly!


The document overview is a handy button in the WordPress block editor’s upper left of the content editing screen. This shows an outline of the page you’re editing. If you’ve structured your content well, it should look like this!

What is Anchor Text and How to Improve Your Link Text?


Anchor Text Overview
Anchor text, also known as link text, is the visible, clickable text in a hyperlink. It typically appears in a different color and is often underlined. Good anchor text provides context about the linked content, enhancing user experience and aiding search engines in understanding the link's relevance.


Why Anchor Text Matters for SEO
Anchor text is crucial for SEO as it helps search engines understand the content of the linked page. It provides context, indicating the topic of the linked content. Effective use of anchor text can boost your rankings by making your site structure clearer to search engines. It also guides users, giving them a preview of what to expect from the link.


Types of Anchor Text


Branded Links: Using your brand name (e.g., Yoast).
URL Links: Displaying the URL itself (e.g., https://yoast.com).
Site Name: Using the site's name (e.g., Yoast.com).
Article Title: Matching the page title (e.g., What is anchor text?).
Exact Keywords: Using your main keyword as anchor text.
Partial Keywords: Variations of your main keyword.
Related Keywords: Keywords closely related to the main one.
Generic Links: Avoid generic phrases like "Click here" or "Read more."
Improving Your Anchor Texts


Create a Natural Flow: Ensure links fit naturally within the text. Forced links can disrupt readability and appear unnatural.
Match Link Text with Content: The anchor text should clearly indicate the linked content. Users should know what to expect upon clicking.
Avoid Deceptive Links: Do not mislead users. The anchor text should accurately describe the linked content.
Make Links Obvious: Ensure link text is distinguishable by using a different color, underlining, or both.
Use Quotation Marks for Long Phrases: To avoid issues with SEO tools, enclose long-tail keyphrases in quotes.
Handling Competing Links with Yoast SEO
Yoast SEO's link focus keyphrase check helps identify and resolve competing links. Competing links use the same focus keyphrase, which can confuse search engines about which page to rank for that keyword. Yoast SEO will alert you if such links are detected, allowing you to adjust the anchor text for better SEO performance.


Best Practices for Internal Links and Anchor Texts


Add Value: Ensure internal links provide real value to users.
Write Clear Anchor Text: Users should understand what the link is about.
Avoid Spam: Don't add links unnecessarily; keep them relevant and useful.
Conclusion
Effective anchor text is vital for both SEO and user experience. By following these guidelines, you can enhance your site's navigation, improve search engine rankings, and provide a better experience for your users. Remember to keep anchor text natural, relevant, and descriptive.

Optimizing Images with Alt and Title Attributes for SEO


Introduction
Adding images to your posts and product pages can significantly enhance engagement and support your message. Properly optimizing these images with alt attributes can improve both SEO and accessibility. This guide explains the importance of alt and title attributes and how to optimize them effectively.


What Are Alt and Title Attributes?
Alt and title attributes are textual descriptions added to images in HTML. They help search engines understand the image content and improve accessibility for visually impaired users.


Complete HTML Image Tag Example:


html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip">
Alt Attributes: Provide a text description of the image for screen readers and search engines.
Title Attributes: Display a tooltip when hovering over the image.
Alt Text
Alt text is crucial for accessibility and SEO. It helps screen readers describe the image to visually impaired users and assists search engines in understanding the image context. Every significant image should have alt text, but purely decorative images can have empty alt attributes to be skipped by screen readers.


Title Text
The title attribute, shown as a tooltip, is not essential for accessibility and is often redundant. It should only be used when the information is relevant and not available elsewhere in the text.


Handling Images Without a Purpose
Purely decorative images should be included in CSS, not HTML. If unavoidable, use an empty alt attribute:


html
Copy code
<img src="image.png" alt="">
Alt Text and SEO
Alt text helps search engines understand what the image depicts and its relevance to the surrounding content. Including relevant keywords in alt text can improve image search rankings. However, avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm user experience and SEO.


Yoast SEO's 'Keyphrase in Image Alt Attributes' Check

Optimizing URL Slugs for SEO in WordPress


Introduction
When discussing SEO for WordPress, the importance of creating the right slug for a page often comes up. A slug is not a slimy creature but a crucial part of your URL that can impact your SEO. This guide explains what a slug is, its importance, and how to optimize it effectively.


What is a Slug?
A slug is the part of a URL that identifies a specific page on a website in a readable form. For example, in the URL https://yoast.com/slug, the slug is slug.


How to Edit a URL Slug


In WordPress:


Open the post or page in the editor.
Edit the slug in the 'Permalink' section.
Ensure your permalink settings allow editing (Settings > Permalinks).
In Shopify:


Open the page in the editor.
Click on the image to reach the image editor screen.
Edit the alt text in the provided field.
Note: Avoid changing permalink settings once your site is live, as it can cause issues.


Why are URL Slugs Important for SEO?
A well-crafted slug can enhance your SEO by:


Including Your Keyword: The slug helps Google determine the page's topic. Ensure your slug contains relevant keywords.
Creating User-Friendly URL Slugs: User-friendly slugs are more likely to be clicked. For example, yoast.com/wordpress-seo is more appealing than yoast.com/?p=607.

Consider Function Words: Default slugs may include unnecessary function words like "a," "the," and "and." Remove them if they don't add clarity.
Add Focus: Remove any unnecessary words to keep the slug concise. For example, change “what-is-a-slug-and-how-to-optimize-it” to “slug.”
Keep it Short and Descriptive: A short, clear slug is more likely to be clicked. Avoid adding dates and unnecessary details.
Use Lowercase Letters Only: Consistently use lowercase to prevent duplicate content issues.
Make Slugs Permanent: Avoid changing slugs after publication, as it can harm SEO and user experience.
Conclusion
Optimizing URL slugs is essential for improving your site's SEO and user experience. By following these guidelines, you can create clear, concise, and effective slugs that help both users and search engines understand your content.

Understanding and Optimizing Keyphrase Distribution in SEO


Introduction
Keyphrase distribution is a crucial aspect of SEO. It ensures that your focus keyphrase is used evenly throughout your text, enhancing both search engine optimization and user experience. This guide explains what keyphrase distribution is, why it matters, and how to improve it using Yoast SEO.


What is Keyphrase Distribution?
Keyphrase distribution refers to how evenly your focus keyphrase, along with its synonyms and related terms, is spread throughout your text. This helps Google understand the topic of your page and ensures your content is balanced and readable.


Why is Keyphrase Distribution Important?


Search Engines: Google needs a clear indication of your page's topic. If your keyphrase is concentrated in one part of the text but absent elsewhere, it confuses search engines. Balanced keyphrase usage helps Google determine the relevance of your content.
User Experience: Overusing a keyphrase in a short span makes the text repetitive and hard to read. Balanced distribution improves readability and helps users find relevant information easily.
The Keyphrase Distribution Check in Yoast SEO
Yoast SEO assesses the evenness of your keyphrase distribution. If your keyphrase or its synonyms are used too heavily in one section and not enough elsewhere, you'll receive an orange or red traffic light. This feature highlights areas needing improvement, helping you achieve a balanced keyphrase distribution.


How to Improve Your Keyphrase Distribution


Include Your Focus Keyphrase Throughout the Text: Ensure your keyphrase appears consistently throughout your content.
Avoid Overusing in Short Sections: Don’t cluster your keyphrase in one part of the text. Spread it evenly to maintain readability.
Use Synonyms: Adding synonyms and related terms can enhance readability and prevent keyword stuffing. Yoast SEO Premium allows you to enter synonyms, which the plugin recognizes and includes in its analysis.
Steps to Optimize Keyphrase Distribution in WordPress


Identify Areas of Imbalance: Use Yoast SEO to highlight sections where the keyphrase is overused or underused.
Rewrite and Adjust: Edit the text to distribute the keyphrase and its synonyms more evenly.
Maintain Readability: Ensure the text flows naturally and remains easy to read while incorporating the keyphrase.
Benefits of Using Synonyms
Using synonyms not only improves readability but also helps with SEO. Google understands context and synonyms better, so varying your terms can make your content more engaging without losing relevance.


Conclusion
Optimizing keyphrase distribution is essential for effective SEO and a better user experience. By following the guidelines and utilizing tools like Yoast SEO, you can ensure your content is balanced, readable, and optimized for search engines. Remember to use your keyphrase evenly, incorporate synonyms, and regularly review your text to maintain optimal keyphrase distribution.

Optimizing Word Count for SEO: A Comprehensive Guide


Introduction
Determining the optimal length for online text can be challenging as it depends on various factors. However, from an SEO and user perspective, there are general guidelines to follow. For blog posts or pages, aim for more than 300 words, while product descriptions should exceed 200 words. This helps Google understand your content and provides sufficient information for your readers. Quality and readability should always be prioritized over sheer length.


Why Does Word Count Matter?
Word count is a simple measure of text length but has significant implications for SEO. Longer texts give Google more context to understand the topic, leading to better rankings. Here’s how longer articles benefit SEO:


Indicator for Google: Longer texts provide more opportunities to naturally include your focus keyphrase and its synonyms, helping Google understand your content.
Ranking for Long-Tail Keywords: Longer articles can cover various aspects of a topic, allowing you to rank for multiple long-tail keywords.
Internal Linking Opportunities: More content provides more chances for internal linking, boosting the SEO of other related posts.
Avoiding Thin Content
Thin content, or pages with very little text, is less likely to rank well as it doesn’t provide comprehensive answers to users' queries. Ensure that product pages and descriptions have enough text to be informative and build trust with potential customers.


Yoast SEO and Text Length
Yoast SEO helps by checking the length of your texts, providing feedback through traffic lights:


Red: Text length is insufficient.
Green: Text meets the minimum word count for the page type.
Recommended Word Counts by Page Type:


Blog Posts/Pages: >300 words
Cornerstone Content: >900 words
Taxonomy Descriptions: >30 words
Product Descriptions: >200 words
Cornerstone Product Descriptions: >400 words
Product Short Descriptions: 20-50 words
Writing High-Quality Lengthy Posts
Longer posts have advantages but maintaining quality is crucial. Here’s how to write high-quality, lengthy content:


Write Readable Texts: Focus on your audience’s needs. Start with a clear topic sentence for each paragraph and keep sentences and paragraphs concise.
Use Headings: Organize your content with headings to improve readability and show the hierarchy of information.
Create Original Content: Reflect on what makes your content unique and ensure it stands out from competitors. Conduct keyword research to address what your audience is searching for.
Optimizing Archive Pages
Archive pages in WordPress (categories, tags) help structure your site. Optimize these pages by:


Adding clear headings and introductions.
Including links to highlight the best posts or products.
Writing descriptive content (minimum 250 words) to help users and search engines understand the page.
Writing High-Quality Product Descriptions
Avoid using default manufacturer text for product descriptions. Unique, detailed descriptions:


Enhance SEO by providing original content.
Build credibility and trust with customers.
Include all necessary information to help users make informed decisions.
Conclusion on Word Count and SEO
Word count can significantly impact SEO, but quality should never be sacrificed for length. Focus on writing well-structured, readable, and informative content that meets the needs of your audience. This approach will ultimately lead to better rankings and a more engaging user experience.

Understanding the Importance of Outbound Links for SEO


Introduction
One of the checks in Yoast SEO is for outbound links, which scans your text to see if there are any outbound links in your post or on your page. If it doesn’t find any, Yoast SEO advises adding at least one. But why is this important? Shouldn’t you focus on keeping visitors on your site? Let's explore the significance of outbound links.


What are Outbound Links?
Outbound links are links from your website to another website. They differ from internal links, which connect pages within your own site. Outbound links guide users to external sources, while internal links help users navigate your site and improve its SEO structure.


What Does the Outbound Links Check Do?
The outbound links check in Yoast SEO counts the number of outbound links in your post or page, including both followed and nofollowed links. Followed links allow search engines to follow them, adding value to your article. Nofollowed links do not contribute to SEO value. Yoast SEO prefers followed links for this check.


How to Add Outbound Links
To pass the outbound links check, ensure you have at least one followed outbound link in every article. Link to credible sources that support your content. This not only improves your SEO but also enhances the perceived Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) of your content.


Why Outbound Links Matter


Building a Connected Web: Outbound links help create a connected web, allowing search engines to understand relationships between different websites. This can improve the overall structure of the web and make it easier for search engines to find and rank relevant content.
Enhancing E-E-A-T: Linking to trustworthy sources shows that you use credible information, which can enhance the E-E-A-T of your content. This is becoming increasingly important for search engines when evaluating content quality.
Supporting SEO for Everyone: By linking to other relevant sites, you contribute to a more connected and fair web, helping other sites rank better and promoting a collaborative online environment.
Do Outbound Links Matter for SEO?
Yes, outbound links are essential for SEO. They contribute to your site's perceived E-E-A-T and help improve the overall SEO landscape. By linking to relevant, authoritative sources, you help build a better web and enhance your own site's credibility and SEO performance.


Conclusion
Including outbound links in your content is crucial for SEO. It helps search engines understand the web better, improves your site's E-E-A-T, and contributes to a more connected and equitable online environment. Always link to relevant, trustworthy sources to pass the Yoast SEO outbound links check and enhance your content's value.

Optimizing Internal Links for SEO: A Comprehensive Guide


Introduction
Before your content can rank, it needs links. Google finds your posts and pages best when linked to from somewhere on the web. Internal links also connect your content and give Google an idea of your website's structure. They can establish a hierarchy, allowing you to provide the most important pages and posts with more link value than other, less valuable pages. Using the right internal linking strategy can boost your SEO! In this article, we’ll discuss the importance of internal linking, how to approach it, and how Yoast SEO can help you with internal linking.


What are Internal Links?
An internal link is any link from one page on your website to another page on your website. Both users and search engines use links to find content on your website. Internal links include links on your homepage, menu, post feed, and within your content. Contextual links, which are links within your content, are particularly important as they point users to related content and help search engines determine the relevance and value of pages.


Internal Links vs. External Links


Internal Links: Connect pages within your website.
External Links: Connect your pages to other websites.
Why are Links Important to Google?
Internal linking is crucial for Google and other search engines because it helps them discover and rank your content. A post or page with many links signals to Google that it’s essential or high-value. Internal links help search engines understand the relationship between content on your site and distribute link value among your pages.


Setting Up an Internal Linking Strategy


Determine Your Site Structure: Imagine your site as a pyramid, with the homepage at the top, categories or sections below, and individual posts and pages further down.
Identify Important Content: Decide which content is most important (cornerstone content) and ensure it receives many internal links.
Add Contextual Links: Link related articles contextually to show their relationship. Link back from cornerstone content to individual posts and vice versa.
Link Hierarchical Pages: Link parent pages to their child pages and sibling pages to each other.
Include a Related Post Section: Use plugins or manually add links to related posts at the end of your articles.
Add Navigational Links: Include links to your most important content in your site’s navigation menu.
Link to Taxonomies: Add internal links to relevant categories and tags to help users and search engines navigate related content.
Link to Recent Posts: Link newly published posts from older content to ensure they are indexed quickly.
Link to Popular Posts: Highlight popular posts in your sidebar or footer to boost their link value and accessibility.
More on Internal Links


Nofollow Links: Avoid nofollowing links on your site; instead, focus on reducing the number of unimportant links.
Anchor Texts: Use descriptive and varied anchor texts to help Google understand the linked content's relevance without over-optimizing.
Internal Linking in Yoast SEO
Yoast SEO includes several checks and features to help you improve your internal linking:


Internal Link Check: Ensures your content has internal links.
Text Link Counter: Counts internal links in a post and links pointing to a post, helping you identify posts that need more links.

Why Your Paragraphs Shouldn’t Be Too Long


Introduction
Properly sized paragraphs play a crucial role in making your text readable. Large blocks of text can be overwhelming and deter readers. Imagine if this entire article were one big paragraph – you’d likely leave the page without even reading the introduction.


Easy to Scan
Paragraphs break down your text into bite-sized, easy-to-understand chunks. This helps readers relax and digest information as they go. When people land on a page, they often scan headings and the first sentences of paragraphs to get an overview. By breaking up your text into paragraphs that reflect the topics you’re addressing, readers can quickly grasp what your article is about.


What Does a Good Paragraph Look Like?
A good paragraph provides information on one well-defined aspect of the topic. It’s also helpful to start each paragraph with a core sentence that summarizes the content. This helps readers decide if a paragraph is interesting to read.


How Long Should Your Paragraph Be?
While context matters, a paragraph should generally be more than two sentences and fewer than 200 words. Long paragraphs can be difficult to understand and may need to be split into smaller sections.


Yoast SEO’s Paragraph Length Check
Yoast SEO checks the length of your paragraphs. The tool advises keeping paragraphs under 150 words for a green light. Paragraphs between 150 and 200 words get an orange light, and those exceeding 200 words receive a red light.


How to Keep Your Paragraphs Short and Crisp


Review Your Text: Break down the main topics and individual aspects.
Structure Before Writing: Organize your headings and paragraphs before starting your article.
Break Up Long Paragraphs: If a topic takes up more space, consider breaking it into two aspects.
Example Outline:

Conclusion
Conclusion
The Yoast SEO paragraph length check helps you avoid writing paragraphs that are too long. Lengthy paragraphs can make it harder for readers to engage with and scan your text. Good paragraphs should discuss a single, well-defined aspect of the topic, start with a core sentence, and generally not exceed 200 words. If you struggle with paragraph length, consider breaking your article down into a schematic view and splitting larger paragraphs into smaller ones.

Avoiding Long Sentences for Better Readability


Introduction
The sentence length check in Yoast SEO warns against using too many long sentences. But what makes a sentence too long? Why should you avoid too many long sentences? And how do you break up a longer sentence into several shorter ones? This article will explain why you shouldn’t use too many long sentences and how to do this!


Why Shouldn’t You Use Too Many Long Sentences?
Longer sentences are generally more difficult to read than shorter sentences. For example:


Although it was clear that Brian had listened intently when it was explained to him what he should do and he had actually followed most of the instructions exactly as the instructor had written down for him on the sheet of paper to make sure he would remember them, he had added the packet of sugar which was already on the kitchen counter rather than the vanilla extract which he actually should have used which was still in the kitchen cabinet because he had forgotten that the instructor had told him to always put every ingredient on the kitchen counter in advance to make sure he wouldn’t forget anything, which completely ruined the recipe as it was that very same vanilla that gave the dessert its distinct flavor.


Phew, are you still there? Long sentences like this one are hard to process because the information isn’t structured clearly. Shorter sentences help you get your message across more effectively:


Brian had listened intently when it was explained to him what he should do. He had followed most of the instructions exactly as the instructor had written them down on paper. The instructor had wanted to make sure he would remember them. But Brian had made a big mistake. He had added the packet of sugar, which was already on the kitchen counter. He should have used the vanilla extract. The extract, however, was still in the kitchen cabinet. He had forgotten that the instructor had told him to always put every ingredient on the kitchen counter in advance. This would’ve helped him remember. The different sugar ruined the recipe. It was the vanilla extract that gave the dessert its distinct flavor.


This fragment is easier to read and more engaging. Shorter sentences improve readability, making it easier for readers to follow your message.


Readability and SEO
Using shorter sentences makes your text easier to read, which is crucial for SEO. Google favors high-quality content that is informative, pleasant to read, and easy to comprehend. Long sentences can confuse readers, leading to a poor user experience, which can negatively impact your SEO.


What Does Yoast SEO’s Sentence Length Check Do?
The sentence length check evaluates the length of your sentences. It counts the words in each sentence and calculates the percentage of sentences longer than 20 words. If more than 25% of your sentences exceed 20 words, you'll be advised to shorten them.


What Makes a Sentence Too Long?
There’s no strict rule for sentence length, but generally, sentences longer than 20 words are harder to read. The key is to avoid having too many long sentences in a row. Use a mix of short and longer sentences to maintain readability.


How to Shorten Your Sentences


Use Transition Words: Break up long sentences into shorter ones and connect them with transition words.


Example: Although it can be a challenge to write shorter sentences, it’s really important to do so, because it makes your sentences easier to read, even if it requires a little more effort.


Revised: It can be a challenge to write shorter sentences. Still, it’s really important to make an effort to do so. After all, it makes your sentences easier to read. It’ll be worth your while!


Avoid Fragments: Ensure every sentence has a subject and a verb and can stand alone.


Example: One of the risks you can run into is that you start writing fragments. A mistake people often make when trying to make their long sentences shorter.


Use Active Voice: Active voice is typically shorter and clearer than passive voice. It helps to convey your message more directly.


Conclusion
Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones improves readability, which is essential for engaging readers and boosting SEO. Avoid stuffing too many thoughts into one sentence. Instead, use transition words to connect ideas across multiple sentences. While some sentences may exceed 20 words, keeping a balance ensures better readability. Follow these guidelines to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

Avoid Repetitive Sentence Beginnings for Better Readability


Introduction
The consecutive sentences check in Yoast SEO for WordPress or Yoast SEO for Shopify warns against using the same word to start consecutive sentences. Why is starting consecutive sentences with the same word a bad idea? How is this related to SEO? And how should you rewrite those sentences? Are there any exceptions? Let’s find out!


Why You Shouldn’t Start Sentences with the Same Words Over and Over
Using the same word to start consecutive sentences can lead to awkward and repetitive writing. It disrupts the flow of your text and tends to put readers off. This is particularly true for words like transition words (and, but, so), relative pronouns (this, that, these, those), and personal pronouns (I, you, it). Articles (the, a, an) are also frequently repeated at the beginning of sentences. Consider this example:


We went shopping in the city to buy some new clothes. And then we had dinner. And then we went for a walk in the park. And then we went to the movies. But the movie was boring. But we still had a good time. But then we went home at 11 PM. And then we went to sleep.


This example is awkward and monotonous. You want your writing to be engaging, not repetitive.


Why It’s Important for SEO
Repetitive sentence beginnings can make your content less enjoyable to read, potentially driving readers away. While it might seem minor, serving your audience the best content possible is crucial for a holistic SEO strategy. Tackling repetitive sentence beginnings is a good start to improving readability and user engagement, which can positively impact SEO.


What Does the Consecutive Sentences Check Do?
The consecutive sentences check assesses whether your text contains three or more sentences in a row starting with the same word. If it does, you’ll get a red bullet and the advice to vary your sentence starters. Headings are also considered in this check. If you click the eye icon, consecutive sentences starting with the same word are highlighted.


How to Tackle Repetitive Sentences
Rewriting repetitive sentences is straightforward. Here are some strategies:


Change Word Order: Rearrange the sentence structure.
Use Synonyms: Find alternative words to express the same idea.
Use Transition Words: Mix up your sentence starters with different transition words.
Revised Example:
First, we went shopping in the city. Once we had found the perfect summer wardrobe, it was time for a nice dinner downtown. After a walk in the park, Julie and I hit the cinema. Unfortunately, the movie was a bit of a letdown. Overall, it was a great day. By now, we were quite tired, so we went home and hit the feathers at 11 PM.


This revised paragraph conveys the same information but is more engaging and readable.


Deliberately Using the Same Words
There are times when starting consecutive sentences with the same word can be effective, such as:


Anaphora: This is a rhetorical device where repetition is used for emphasis and style. For example, Winston Churchill’s speech during WWII:


We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.


Enumerations: When listing steps or items, using the same words can add clarity:


If you want Google to crawl and index your page, then you should…
If you don’t want Google to index your page, you should…
If you don’t want Google to index your page, you could also…


However, be careful not to overuse this technique outside of lists or stylistic purposes, as it can still lead to monotonous writing.


Conclusion
If the consecutive sentences check gives you a red bullet, identify and fix unintended repetitiveness. Repeating the same words at the beginning of sentences can bore readers and drive them away. Enrich your sentences with synonyms and transition words. If needed, rephrase sentences or rearrange them. Varying your writing style will improve readability and keep your audience engaged.

Why Avoiding Passive Voice is Crucial for Readability and SEO


Introduction
Understanding the passive voice and why you should avoid it is essential for effective writing. In the readability analysis in Yoast SEO, we recommend using the passive voice in a maximum of 10% of your sentences. This post will explain what passive voice is, why it's best to avoid it, what the Yoast SEO passive voice check does, and how to reduce passive voice in your writing. Finally, we’ll describe some situations where using passive voice is appropriate.


What is the Passive Voice?
The passive voice is a grammatical construction where the receiver of an action becomes the subject of the sentence. It contrasts with the active voice, where the actor (subject) performs the action. Here's a comparison:


Active Voice: Mom hugged me.
Passive Voice: I was hugged by Mom.
In passive sentences, the actor can sometimes be omitted, as in "I was hugged."


Why Should You Avoid the Passive Voice?
Using passive voice often makes your writing less clear and more distant for two main reasons:


Wordiness: Passive sentences are generally longer. For example:


Active: The passive voice makes your message less clear.
Passive: Your message is made less clear by the passive voice.
The passive sentence is longer and more cumbersome.


Complex Sentence Structure: Passive sentences require more cognitive effort to understand because the usual subject-verb-object order is reversed. This can make your writing harder to follow and less engaging.


What Does the Yoast SEO Passive Voice Check Do?
The Yoast SEO passive voice check evaluates the percentage of sentences using passive voice in your text. You'll get a green bullet if less than 10% of your sentences are passive. It turns red if more than 15% are passive. This helps ensure your writing is clear and direct.


How to Use Less Passive Voice in Your Copy
Almost every passive sentence has an active counterpart. Here are some examples for different tenses:


Present Simple:


Passive: A book is bought by me.
Active: I buy a book.
Present Continuous:


Passive: A book is being bought by me.
Active: I am buying a book.
Present Perfect:


Passive: A book has been bought by me.
Active: I have bought a book.
Past Simple:


Passive: A book was bought by me.
Active: I bought a book.
Past Continuous:


Passive: A book was being bought by me.
Active: I was buying a book.
Past Perfect:


Passive: A book had been bought by me.
Active: I had bought a book.
Future:


Passive: A book will be written by me.
Active: I will write a book.
Future Perfect:


Passive: A book will have been written by me.
Active: I will have written a book.
What Are the Exceptions?
Sometimes, using passive voice is necessary, such as when the actor is unknown or irrelevant. For example:


Passive Voice: In the passive voice, the actor and receiver are switched around.
Here, there is no specific actor, and using passive voice is clearer.


Another example is when focusing on the receiver:


Passive Voice: J.F. Kennedy was killed in 1963 in Dallas, Texas by Lee Harvey Oswald.
In such cases, passive voice is appropriate and effective.


Conclusion
Active sentences are usually clearer and more engaging than passive ones. After writing your text, check for passive voice constructions and consider if a better, active alternative is available. If not, use passive voice appropriately. Aim to keep passive sentences under 10% for optimal readability and SEO.

Using Transition Words to Improve Readability and SEO


Introduction
Using transition words in your writing can significantly enhance the readability of your content. They help your text flow smoothly and show readers the relationship between phrases and paragraphs. That’s why the readability checks in Yoast SEO provide feedback on your use of transition words. But what are transition words, and why are they so important? And how should you use them?


What Are Transition Words?
Transition words like ‘and,’ ‘but,’ ‘so,’ and ‘because’ show readers the relationship between phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs. They act as the glue that holds your text together, turning individual sentences into a cohesive whole.


An Example
Consider this example:


Without transition words: I pushed the domino. It fell over.
With transition words: I pushed the domino. As a result, it fell over.
The phrase ‘as a result’ shows the cause-and-effect relationship between the two sentences, making the connection clear to the reader.


Transition Words Can Connect (Almost) Anything
Transition words can connect short phrases, entire paragraphs, or even different sections of your text. For example:


I enjoy his company because he always tells interesting stories.
In this case, ‘because’ connects two clauses and explains why you enjoy his company.
Transition Word at the End of a Sentence
You don’t always have to place transition words at the beginning of a sentence:


He’s a very nice guy. He took us out to dinner yesterday, for instance.
Here, ‘for instance’ is placed at the end but still clarifies the relationship between the sentences.
Does It Really Make a Difference?
Yes, it does! Let's compare two texts, one with and one without transition words.


Text A: Without Transition Words
I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to learning skills. The only way to truly master a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are people who disagree. It is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they’ve heard or read. That number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. Following up explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.


Text B: With Transition Words
In this paragraph, I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to mastering skills. Firstly, the only way to truly learn a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. Secondly, I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are, however, people who disagree. Thirdly, and most importantly, it is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they read or hear. Moreover, that number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. In conclusion, following up explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.


Text B is easier to read and shows clear relationships between sentences and arguments. This makes the text more engaging and helps readers understand and retain the information.


Types of Transition Words
Transition words can be categorized based on the type of connection they make:


Transition        Example Word/Phrase        Example Sentence
Cause and Effect        Therefore, as a result, so, consequently        I’m tired. Therefore, I’m going to bed.
Clarification        That is to say, in other words, to clarify        We’re letting you go. In other words, you’re fired.
Contrast        But, however, on the other hand        I am not fond of fruit. However, I do like bananas.
Example        For example, for instance        In the evening, I like to relax. For instance, I enjoy watching TV.
Emphasis        Above all, most importantly, certainly        There are many reasons to exercise regularly. Above all, it keeps you healthy.
Enumeration        Firstly/secondly, further, and, moreover, in addition        Today, I’m going to write a post. In addition, I’m recording some video lessons.
Time        Meanwhile, during, subsequently, after that        I’ll start by telling you what transition words are. After that, I’ll tell you why you should always use them.
Similarity        Likewise, similarly, in the same vein        She tried really hard to entertain her guests. Similarly, he put all his heart and soul into cooking a great dinner.
Summarize/Conclude        In conclusion, to sum up, in short        In conclusion, transition words are an important aspect of SEO copywriting.
Why Are Transition Words Important for SEO?
Transition words enhance readability, a key factor in SEO. They make your content easier to understand, which helps attract and retain readers. This improves user experience, a crucial element for SEO success.


What Does the Transition Word Check in Yoast SEO Do?
The transition words check in Yoast SEO assesses your use of these linking words. If at least 30% of your sentences contain a transition word, you get a green light. You get an orange light if you use them in 20-30% of your sentences, and a red light if less than 20% of your sentences have a transition word.


How to Improve Your Usage
To use transition words effectively, you need to:


Know the Words: Understand the different transition words and their meanings.
Understand the Relationships: Break down your text into an introduction, body, and conclusion. Know the purpose of each paragraph and find opportunities to use transition words to show the relationships between ideas.
Conclusion
Transition words are crucial for readability and SEO. They help readers understand your text by showing the relationships between ideas. To use them effectively, understand their meanings and the structure of your text. If you do, your writing will be clearer, more engaging, and better optimized for SEO.

Understanding the Word Complexity Assessment in Yoast SEO


Introduction
The word complexity assessment in Yoast SEO Premium and Yoast SEO for Shopify checks whether a text contains too many complex words. But what is a complex word? How many complex words are too many? What is the scientific reasoning behind this assessment? This article will answer these questions and more.

Conclusion
The Word Complexity Assessment
The word complexity assessment checks your text and highlights complex words according to our definition. It also tells you the percentage of complex words in your text. The more uncommon and complicated words you use, the harder it might be for your visitors to fully grasp your message. The feedback from Yoast SEO helps you identify and change these complex words.


The assessment is available in English, Spanish, German, and French, with support for more languages to be added in future updates of Yoast SEO Premium.


How the Assessment Works
To define a complex word, we used datasets from several research studies involving native and non-native participants. We then created a model to discern between complex and non-complex words based on their length and frequency.


For the English language, a word is considered complex if:


It’s longer than seven characters AND
It does not appear in the top 5000 most frequent words AND
It does not start with a capital letter.
For instance, ‘trajectory’ is complex because it meets these conditions. Words starting with a capital letter are excluded as they usually refer to specific names or titles.


The feedback strings for the assessment are:


Good (green traffic light): Fewer complex words make your text easy to read.
Okay (orange traffic light): A percentage of the words in your text are complex. Try to use shorter and more familiar words to improve readability.
Bad (red traffic light): Triggered for cornerstone content with too many complex words.
If less than 10% of the words in your text are complex, your text is considered easy to understand. If more than 10% are complex, we recommend using shorter and more common words.


Using the Assessment to Your Advantage
The assessment runs in the background as you write. Clicking the eye icon next to the feedback in your sidebar will highlight complex words. You can then decide whether to replace these words.


Remember, Yoast SEO’s feedback may include words that are not complex for you or your audience. If that’s the case, you can skip those suggestions. Sometimes, specialized words are necessary for your audience, such as in business reports or research summaries.


Why Do We Have This Feature?
In today’s interconnected world, people use the internet to find quick answers. They may come to your site from Google, quickly scan your content, and leave if it’s not easy to understand. Moreover, if your website content is in English, it’s likely to attract visitors from various countries.


Making your content accessible and easily understood without affecting your message opens it up to a broader audience. Easy-to-read content keeps visitors engaged and on your site longer. Reducing sentence length and the number of complex words is the first step toward making your text more readable. The word complexity assessment helps you identify and replace rarely used words with more common alternatives.


What About the Flesch Reading Ease Score?
Previously, the Flesch reading ease score provided a sense of how difficult a text would be to understand. While it works well, we wanted something more actionable. For instance, if you have a post with an FRE score of 45 (considered difficult to read), how do you make it easier to understand? Where do you start?


With this in mind, we developed the word complexity assessment. This feature is more actionable because it directly measures readability and offers specific feedback on complex words. The Flesch reading ease score is still available in the Insight tab, where you’ll find the score along with other insights like word count, reading time, and prominent words. However, it is no longer used in the readability analysis.


Conclusion
The word complexity assessment in Yoast SEO helps make your text more accessible by identifying complex words and suggesting replacements. This improves readability and helps keep visitors engaged with your content. By understanding and using this assessment, you can make your writing clearer and more effective.

Why Your Post or Page Needs Only One H1 Heading


Introduction
The title of your post or page usually gets the H1 heading tag. It’s logical to give your post one title, right? Having more than one H1 is like saying: “Hey, this text is about two topics of equal importance.” Yoast SEO warns you with a red traffic light if you use more than one H1 heading. Here, we’ll explain why your post or page only needs one H1 heading.

Conclusion
Heading Structure and SEO
In many CMSs like WordPress or Shopify, headings are ordered in ranks (or levels). The highest rank is H1, the title of your post or page. In the rest of the text, you use H2 – H6 headings. With them, you indicate the importance of each section and how it relates to the rest of the text. So, when a reader lands on your page, the headings help them make sense of the content. It helps readers scan the text and learn how it fits together.


Search engines also “read” headings and try to understand the structure of your text. Instead of the regular text you and I read, they go to the HTML version of your site and read the HTML heading tags. The headings help them comprehend the relative importance of your text’s (sub)topic.


One or Multiple H1s?
As mentioned above, the H1 is the title of your post (not to be confused with the SEO title). We suggest using the H1 heading only once. Here’s why:


Clarity: Headings help readers and Google understand your text. If there are multiple H1 headings, your readers and Google might get confused. People might get confused, distracted, or even frustrated when there’s no clear distinction between main and subtopics. As a result, they may leave your site.
Accessibility: Proper use of headings makes your text more accessible. Think of visually impaired people who use screen readers. These devices can use headings to navigate through your text. More than one H1 in one article complicates this, and without visual cues, it might confuse people even more.
Using other headings (H2-H6) as much as you need is perfectly acceptable. Still, you should keep in mind that headings are hierarchical. For example, you should use H2 before you use H3 within a particular topic. Check out this extensive guide on headings and SEO if you want to use them optimally.


What Does the Single H1 Heading Check in Yoast SEO Do?
The single H1 assessment of Yoast SEO (both in our WordPress SEO plugin and Shopify SEO app) checks whether the body of your text contains an H1 heading at any position other than the very beginning. If Yoast SEO detects an H1 heading in the body of your text, it gives you a red bullet in the feedback. Luckily, solving this issue is straightforward.


Finding and Changing Your H1 Headings
To ensure your post doesn’t have double titles, you’ll need to find all H1s in your text and change them to a lower heading level.


Changing an H1 Heading in the Classic Editor in WordPress
If you click one of your headings in the classic editor, the clickable drop-down menu in the upper left corner will show the heading level you’ve selected. You can change it to another level by opening the drop-down menu and selecting another level. If the Yoast SEO feedback indicates that your text contains more than one H1 heading, check all your headings by clicking them. Then, select another level to change your H1 into H2 or another appropriate heading.


Changing an H1 Heading in the Block Editor in WordPress
In the block editor, Yoast SEO helps you find the H1s quickly. Click the eye icon next to the assessment and see the H1 titles highlighted in the editor. If you want to change the level of your headings, click them. The menu bar above the block shows you the level of the heading. Then, select another level to change your H1 into H2 or another appropriate heading.


Changing an H1 Heading in Shopify
When you go to one of your products or blog posts in the backend of Shopify, you’ll notice the ‘Title’ field at the top. This is where you fill in your title (which is automatically your H1 on that page).


In the description field below, you can write your product description or blog post and add headings by clicking the ‘Paragraph’ button above the content field. This dropdown allows you to add headings of different levels. If you get a red traffic light for your H1 assessment in Yoast SEO, find the wrong headings by clicking the eye icon. When you’ve found the H1 in your content, change it into H2 or another appropriate heading.


Conclusion
Using headings in the right way helps your SEO. What you learned from this post is quite simple. An H1 heading is the title of your post. You don’t want double or triple titles, so use the H1 heading only once.

By leveraging technology, Class2Class.org aims to break down geographic and cultural barriers, enabling teachers and students to collaborate on projects, share experiences, and learn from each other in a dynamic, supportive environment. The platform offers a variety of tools and features to facilitate communication, project management, and content sharing, making it easier for educators to bring global perspectives into their classrooms. 

Purpose of the Document
This document is crafted to provide a comprehensive overview of the features and functionalities available on the Class2Class.org platform. It serves as a detailed guide for current and prospective users, including educators, students, and administrators, to better understand how the platform can enhance the educational experience through global collaboration. Additionally, this document aims to highlight the platform’s ease of use, its wide array of features, and its potential to impact teaching and learning positively. Whether you are navigating the platform for the first time or looking to explore more deeply its capabilities, this guide offers the insights and instructions needed to maximize the benefits of Class2Class.org for your classroom and beyond.

Getting Started
This section provides a roadmap for new users of Class2Class.org, guiding teachers and students through the initial steps required to become active participants in the global classroom community. By following this guide, users will be able to seamlessly navigate the registration process, understand the platform's features, and begin connecting and collaborating with peers worldwide.

Registration and Authentication
Process for teachers
To join the Class2Class.org platform (https://platform.class2class.org), teachers start by accessing the sign-up page on our website at https://platform.class2class.org/login?s=mode. Here, they will be prompted to enter basic information such as their first name, last name, email address, and password.
After submitting their registration form, teachers will receive a verification email with a link to confirm their email address and activate their account with a 4-digit code that they must enter in the account confirmation screen on the platform.
Once their email is verified, the first screen that teachers will see is the full profile section where they will be encouraged to complete their profile by adding details such as their full basic information such as country, their profile picture, time zone, a short description of themselves and the languages they speak.
Aside from the basic information, they will need to complete their class details by providing their school name, ages of students, grade levels, and subjects they teach.
Finally, they will need to provide their educational interests, specifically the SDGs of interest and the level of collaboration they are interested in from our 4-step learning journey.
User onboarding
Process for teachers
When the teacher finishes completing his profile, the platform teaches him through an in-app tour how to connect with other teachers. After that, he/she is taken to the home page, where he/she is shown the purpose of each of the sections displayed, and finally shown an onboarding checklist that he/she must complete to familiarize him/herself with the platform's key functionalities and learn how to navigate its interface. In addition to the checklist, Class2Class.org offers an interactive guided tour that walks users through the platform's main sections and functionalities. The tour provides real-time navigation assistance, highlighting features such as how to send connection requests, how to post or respond to collaboration requests, create projects, and where to find resources for projects. This guided experience is designed to make users comfortable with the platform's environment, encouraging them to dive into the global collaboration opportunities available at Class2Class.org.
Main Features
The platform offers 6 navigation menus for teachers, which we will call sections. The purpose of each section and the functionalities that exist within each of them are detailed below. 
Home section
URL: https://platform.class2class.org/home_professor/home

This section shows the user's progress with respect to the Class2Class.org 4-level learning journey. Here they can see how many level 1 "Get to know each other", level 2 "work toward the SDGs", level 3 "create solutions to real problems", and level 4 "present my solution" projects they have successfully completed.

There is also a "Quick Actions" area where the teacher can invite students, post project requests, create projects, refer a teacher, create resources and contact support.

There is also a section where collaboration requests are listed, so that the teacher can reply to them and initiate a collaboration that interests him/her.

Finally, there is a section where the onboarding checklist is displayed with the following options: "Getting started" which shows a video of what Class2Class.org is, "Complete my profile", which displays the in-app tour that teaches the teacher how to complete his/her profile, "Connect with other teachers", which displays the in-app tour that teaches the teacher how to connect with other teachers, through the Connect menu, "Get inspiration from others", which takes the teacher to the Inspire section or menu, which shows featured projects that can serve as a source of inspiration for teachers, "Invite my students", which deploys an in-app tour that teaches the teacher how to invite their students to the platform through the "My students" menu, and finally "Create a project" which deploys an in-app tour that teaches the teacher how to create a collaborative project from scratch.
Posting a collaboration request
Teachers can post a collaboration request to find other teachers interested in a collaboration project idea they have. To do this, teachers should go to a section within the home page called “Quick Actions”, where they will find the option “Post project request”. Clicking on this option will open a form that they will have to fill in with the information of the project they wish to carry out such as the age range of the students, English level of the students, and type of collaboration according to the 4 levels of the class2class learning journey, the description of the project, the expected month in which they wish to start the collaboration project and the title of the request. 

This information will be helpful for teachers within the Class2Class.org community to understand the type of collaboration they are seeking to develop and reply to this request.
My Students section
URL: https://platform.class2class.org/home_professor/students 

In this section, teachers can invite students and group them into classes. There are three options for inviting students. The first is by entering the emails of each of their students one by one, the second is by sending the students an invitation link so that they can register by invitation from their teacher, and the third option is through a QR code that students can scan to register on the platform.

After sending the invitations, teachers have access to a subsection within the "My Students" menu called "Invited", to see the list of students they have invited.
Connect section
URL: https://platform.class2class.org/home_professor/connect 

In this section teachers can connect with other teachers around the world. All teachers on the platform who have an active account are listed here.

This section has a list of teachers divided in two parts, the first one is the automatic recommendations section called “Recommended teachers for you”, where the platform recommends profiles similar to those of the user teacher. And below this section is the complete list of users called “All teachers” that can be filtered by country, age range of students, type of collaboration and the SDGs you are interested in.

Aside of the teacher directory, all the connections made can also be managed through subsections called "Matches" which lists all the connections established between teachers, "Incoming" which lists all the teacher profiles from which the user teacher has received a connection request, and "Sent" which lists all the teacher profiles to which the user teacher has sent a connection request.

Finally, if you click on a user profile, a profile page is displayed with the details of that teacher, so you can have more information such as: full name, country, time difference, languages spoken, a brief description, age of students, days and hours available to connect, subjects taught and SDGs and type of collaboration of interest in relation to the learning journey of Class2Class.org.

The SDGs of interest are the 17 UN SDGs, and the collaboration interests are selected from the four (4) levels of the Class2Class.org learning journey:

Level 1: Get to know each other
Level 2: Working towards the SDGs
Level 3: Create solutions to real problems
Level 4: Present my solution
Collaborate section
URL: https://platform.class2class.org/home_professor/collaborate 

In this section teachers can create international collaboration projects, view finished projects, and accept invitations to collaboration projects from other teachers.
In order to create a project, there is a button called "Create new project" which when clicked opens a pop-up with the following information: Project Topic or Name, Select the type of collaboration, and Project description. After completing these fields, the teacher will be able to click on the "Create" button on the form and create his/her project on the platform.

After completing the project creation form, the platform will redirect the teacher to the project page where he/she can add teachers and students to his/her project, add resources, share information through the project board (which works as a project wall), and finally get project completion certificates for both teachers and students involved in the project.

On the project page, you'll also find a "Group Chat" button that allows you to chat with all project participants. 

Finally, there's a "Share Project" button that can be used by the teacher to share the project with other teachers or students outside of the Class2Class.org platform so that they can participate in the project without having to have an account. It can also be used to show the work they are doing to other teachers or the head of their educational institution.
